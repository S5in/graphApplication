Hello there,

  In the folder above I have an incredible GUI Graph Application.
It has some issues that can be fixed, but it works pretty solid
now and can help you understand how the graph's components work: nodes, edges, etc.
That's my first Java GUI application! Anyways, thank you for being here.

Have a great day, stranger!
